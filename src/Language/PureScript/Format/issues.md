issues: 
Lone surrogates etc, string handling: 
    - examples/passing/2438.purs
    - examples/passing/StringEdgeCases/Records.purs
    --> check pretty instance for PSString in Pretty.hs

differentiation between let in's and where in AST?
    - any file with a let in, for example: 
    - examples/passing/2689.purs
    - examples/passing/1991.purs
    - examples/passing/2689.purs

type declaration infix functions: 
    - examples/passing/LiberalTypeSynonyms.purs
    - examples/passing/Collatz.purs

- to be decided: 
    Differentiation between forall and ∀ --> currently always uses ∀
